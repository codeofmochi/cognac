## Development containers

This folder contains definitions and configuration of [development containers (devcontainers)](https://containers.dev/) for this project.

With devcontainers, developers do not need to install the entire toolchain to compile and run the application(s) of the workspace themselves, instead the devcontainers definitions contain all the development infrastructure as code.

The only requirement is thus a container runtime (e.g. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/)). Many IDEs also support devcontainer integration: you can use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
